\value{
Artifact distribution object (matrix of artifact-distribution means and variances) for use artifact-distribution meta-analyses.
}
\description{
This function generates artifact-distribution objects containing either interactive or Taylor series artifact distributions.
Use this to create objects that can be supplied to the \code{\link{ma_r_ad}} and \code{\link{ma_r_ad}} functions to apply psychometric corrections to barebones meta-analysis objects via artifact distribution methods.

Allows consolidation of observed and estimated artifact information by cross-correcting artifact distributions and forming weighted artifact summaries.

For u ratios, error variances can be computed for independent samples (i.e., settings in which the unrestricted standard deviation comes from an external study) or
dependent samples (i.e., settings in which the range-restricted standard deviation comes from a sample that represents a subset of the applicant sample that provided the
unrestricted standard deviation). The former circumstance is presumed to be more common, so error variances are computed for independent samples by default.
