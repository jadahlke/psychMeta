Description: Tools for computing bare-bones and psychometric meta-analyses and for generating psychometric data for use in meta-analysis simulations. Supports bare-bones, individual-correction, and artifact-distribution methods for meta-analyzing correlations and d values. Includes tools for converting effect sizes, computing sporadic artifact corrections, reshaping meta-analytic databases, computing multivariate corrections for range variation, and more. Bugs can be reported to <https://github.com/jadahlke/psychmeta/issues> or <issues@psychmeta.com>.
