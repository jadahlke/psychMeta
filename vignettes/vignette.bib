  abstract = {Generalization in meta-analyses is not a dichotomous decision (typically encountered in papers using the \emph{Q} test for homogeneity, the 75\% rule, or null hypothesis tests). Inattention to effect size variability in meta-analyses may stem from a lack of guidelines for interpreting credibility intervals. In this commentary, we describe two methods for making practical interpretations and determining whether a particular SDœÅ represents a meaningful level of variability.},
